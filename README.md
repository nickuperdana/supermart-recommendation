# Situation:
The retail business still holds promise for expansion in the retail domain. This is supported by the gradually recovering economy from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected countries worldwide for over two years.

India is one of the countries with promising prospects in the retail business. This is evidenced by the country's advancing economy and its dense population, making it one of the most populous in the world. These factors indicate considerable potential for consumer goods-based retail businesses in the country.

# Complication:
Exploring business opportunities in India reveals the presence of only one reliable public dataset owned by Supermart Retail Business, which serves as a benchmark for business considerations. Additionally, factors such as states, cities, and the types of consumer goods that can be sold need to be considered to achieve business profitability and performance.

# Questions:
Based on the situation, some business questions that need exploration are as follows:
- How many product categories are sold by Supermart, along with their respective subcategories?
- What are the trends in sales and profit figures for Supermart outlets?
- Which city has the highest average sales and profit figures?
- Who are the most loyal customers choosing Supermart as their preferred shopping destination?
- What is the average profit generated by each category throughout the transaction recording period?
- What is the potential range of minimum and maximum average profits per transaction that can be obtained by opening a minimarket in Tamil Nadu?
- What is the sales and profit performance of minimarket businesses in Tamil Nadu each year?
- Is there a correlation between sales profit and sales figures?
- Do different cities have varying profit per transaction differences?
- Do different categories have different profit per transaction differences, and if so, which one is more profitable?

# Answer/Action:
To achieve the goals that address these questions, the following steps can be taken using the S.M.A.R.T. framework:

- **Specific:** Increase profitable income for sale in the state of Tamil Nadu, India.
- **Measurable:** Increase profit per transaction income by 5% above average by franchising minimarkets in Tamil Nadu.
- **Achievable:** Perform secondary data analysis with the sales dataset of products sold by Supermart in Tamil Nadu, India. Find sales and profit figures obtained in several cities. Explore profitable product varieties to sell (profit-sales ratio per product). Explore the sales and profit trends of Supermart each year. Explore the relationship between the sales figure and the profit that will be obtained. Explore the difference in sales profit between cities.
- **Relevance:** India is the country with the second-largest population in the world. Tamil Nadu is the second most populous state in India. Supermart is offering overseas franchise business opportunities by offering franchises overseas.
- **Time-bound:** Achieve a 5% increase in profit income in the first month since the business initiation.

# Findings and Conclusion:
After observation and statistical calculations, the Supermart franchise business in Tamil Nadu, India, is highly recommended.

Every year, the purchase transaction value and profit obtained tend to increase. There is also a tendency where the ratio of net profit to total sales each year also tends to increase over time, around 25%. There is a tendency where the profit obtained is positively proportional to the sales income obtained by the store. Considering that India is the second most populous country in the world, and Tamil Nadu is the sixth most populous state in India, the Supermart store business in Tamil Nadu, India, is relevant and has quite good prospects for the future.

In addition to leveraging business potential related to the large population of the state that can be acquired as customers, Supermart also needs to consider attractive membership schemes for loyal customers. It is known that the Amrish customer is the most loyal customer because he has shopped 225 times over a period of 4 years.

Specifically, there are no specific factors to consider in doing business with Supermart stores in Tamil Nadu, as there are no significant differences in profit per transaction depending on the city where the store is located or on specific categories that the store sells. However, based on the potential minimum and maximum average profit per transaction values analyzed, the cities of Vellore, Perambalur, Trichy, Karur, and Bodi are the top recommended cities to pursue business goals to achieve an average income of 5% above the overall transaction average. Additionally, the cities of Dharmapuri, Ooty, Ramanadhapuram, Kanyakumari, Madurai, Salem, Cumbum, and Pudukottai are other top cities to explore the franchise business potential as they still have the potential to further increase average profit income.
